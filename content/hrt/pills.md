## Introduction

Estradiol valerate (trade name: Progynova) or hemihydrate (trade name: Zumenon) is usually the initial method for feminising hormone replacement therapy, it will often be prescribed with an anti-androgen like cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. A starting dose is often 2mg, and while this is definitely quite low, it does give you time to determine if HRT is right for you with virtually no downside if you back out.

## Dosage and Delivery

Dosages can be increased easily to reach expected levels of a cis woman as tested by regular blood tests, often at 3 month intervals unti stabilised, and then every 6 months or at your doctor's discretion. It is common for trans women to move on to 4mg and higher up to 8mg typically once we are confident in our transition, as per the AusPath guidelines. This may be all at once, or spread out over the day.

It is worth considering moving from PO (per oral) administration to sublingual, placing the tablet/s under your tongue, once certainty has been reached, this will allow you to continue your existing prescription, and bypass the "first pass effect" of the liver, providing a higher peak of oestrogen in the body, with the downside being a shorter half life, again, invoking a consideration of taking pills over the day.

## What to Expect

Common experiences on starting with oral estradiol is euphoria, excitement at beginning your transition, many people feel relieved to just begin, even after artificially delaying intake after receiving medication.

In the first month, especially on 2mg, expect changes to be few and subtle. You should notice skin softening, and may suffer mild pain or discomfort in the breasts. Your nipples may soften and enlarge, while also having periods of being semi-permanently erect.

It's important to note no one's development will be exactly the same, this goes for trans people just as much as cis people.

## What to do

A good idea is to get a padded sports bra by about week 3, these can often be purchased in discrete colours if you are not out yet.

It is also worth considering before or after this point accessing hair removal services from beauticeans, there are several different types, but for your own comfort it may be worth focusing on visible areas. Some hair removal businesses are not yet comfortable serving trans women.
