# Readme

This will be the basis of an information resource for trans, non-binary and gender diverse people living in Australia, and the healthcare professionals who serve them, from a patient perspective.

We will attempt to cover HRT and anti-androgen medications, supportive therapies, and point to resources available to users.

This is not a replacement for professional medical and mental health care.
