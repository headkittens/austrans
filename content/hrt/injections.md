## Introduction

This is one of the common delivery methods of testosterone for transmasculine people, but is not generally offered to transfeminine people, who will need to seek a prescription to be filled at a compounding pharmacy. It can be mildly uncomfortable and the injection site may bleed slightly and be sore to the touch or in general for the rest of the day. **You will need access to a sharps container.** These can be purchased from your local pharmacy, and may be provided free of charge from sexual health clinics or charities.

**Testosterone is a controlled substance**, and as the writer of this document is transfeminine, we will need further information to appropriately discuss administration, so the rest of this article is only suitable for transfeminine people.

## Methods

Injection is usually subcutaneous, injected below the skin, or intramuscular, injected into the muscles. Subcutaneous injections will usually last longer between injections, as blood isn't perfused as much as it is in the muscles, though will provide lower peaks. When self administering, typically you want sites you have good access to and can monitor. Subcutaneous sites like the stomach are often ideal for diabetes sufferers, while intramuscular may settle for the thigh. Sites should be rotated to the opposite side for each injection.

## Dosage

Estradiol valerate 10mg/mL, suggested dose of 1.5mL and adjust for blood tests.

## Preparation

- Vial of estradiol valerate
- Syringe
  - This may come with a pre-fitted/permanent tip suitable for subcut or IM injection, or you may need to supply your own
  - If interchangeable tip, it's advised to use a drawing tip (18G) to prepare dose and change to a suitable injection tip
    - 23G for intramuscular
    - 25G for subcutaneous
  - Every puncture damages the needle tip, so using the same needle for drawing and injecting may make for a more painful experience - it is accepted practice, it's just not *best* practice.
    - ***NEVER*** reuse syringes
- A sharps container
- Alcohol swabs
  - You may consider wiping the top of the vial with the same swab and then the injection site to promote cleanliness
- Cotton buds/gauze/clean tissue
- A bandage, or paper medical tape to secure the cotton bud

## Subcutaneous Injection

To perform a prepared subcutaneous injection of estradiol valerate
1. Cleanse the injection site with an alcohol swab
2. Pinch a small section of skin and insert the syringe at a 45 degree angle
3. Slowly empty the contents
4. Remove the syringe and hold a cotton bud, a clean tissue, or a small piece of guaze over the injection site as you do so
5. Dispose of the syringe safely in a sharps container. *Do not attempt to recap the syringe.*
6. Replace cotton bud/gauze/tissue with a bandage, or secure the cotton bud/gauze with paper medical tape

## Intramuscular Injection in the vastus lateralis muscle

To perform a prepared intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate
1. Identify a suitable site on the thigh
  - This is done by dividing the thigh into 9 rectangles in a 3x3 grid, and picking a spot on the outer-middle section
2. Cleanse the injection site with an alcohol swab
3. Insert the syringe at a 90 degree angle to the body, a right angle
4. Slowly empty the contents
5. Remove the syringe and hold a cotton bud, a clean tissue, or a small piece of guaze over the injection site as you do so
6. Dispose of the syringe safely in a sharps container. *Do not attempt to recap the syringe.*
7. Replace cotton bud/gauze/tissue with a bandage, or secure the cotton bud/gauze with paper medical tape
